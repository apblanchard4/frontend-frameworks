# Comparing Front End Frameworks
_Independent Study for CS4241: Webware: Computational Technology for Network Information Systems_

---

## Overview  
This project involved the development of five applications to explore and compare the capabilities, performance, and developer experience of various front-end frameworks and libraries. The study provided insights into strengths and weaknesses of each technology, enabling informed decisions for future web development projects.

---

## Applications  
1. **Svelte**  
2. **SvelteKit**  
3. **React**  
4. **Remix**  
5. **Vanilla JavaScript**  

Each application was built to implement similar features, allowing for a consistent comparison across frameworks.

---

## Technologies Used  
- **Svelte**: Lightweight, compiler-based framework for building fast web applications.  
- **SvelteKit**: Framework for building web applications with built-in routing and server-side rendering.  
- **React**: Component-based library for building interactive UIs.  
- **Remix**: Full-stack web framework focusing on performance and user experience.  
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Minimal implementation without additional libraries or frameworks.

## Results 
This comparison of front-end frameworks examines five popular options—Vanilla JS, Svelte, SvelteKit, React with Next.js, and Remix—highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and suitability for different types of projects. Vanilla JS offers simplicity and speed, but lacks scalability and security features. Svelte stands out with its compile-time approach, resulting in lightweight, fast applications, though it faces limitations in community support. SvelteKit builds on Svelte, adding server-side rendering and routing capabilities, making it ideal for dynamic applications but with a steeper learning curve. React with Next.js provides powerful tools for server-side rendering and optimization but comes with a complex setup. Remix, focused on server-side rendering and client-side navigation, emphasizes performance but has seen a decline in popularity. The choice between these frameworks depends on project requirements, developer experience, and personal preference, with Svelte and React emerging as strong contenders based on speed, popularity, and development ease.
